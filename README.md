Includes SparkBeyond feature reports and figures in the paper (including data from external sources), in the reports folder.
Data folder includes data used for model training, analysis and also some predicted novel miRNA regulated proteins/genes for various species, e.g. arabidopsis thaliana, Zebrafish (e.g. [data/export-preds_30_thale_zebra_candidate_mirgene.csv.zip](https://github.com/LinialLab/microRNA-Protein-Regulation/blob/main/data/export-preds_30_thale_zebra_candidate_mirgene.csv.zip)).
